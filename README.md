# SnakeGame_JS

Creating a simple Snake game in JavaScript can be a fun and educational project. I'll provide you with a basic implementation to get you started. We'll use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this game. 

Set up the HTML structure
Create the CSS styles (styles.css)
Implement the JavaScript logic (snake.js)

This is a basic implementation of a Snake game in JavaScript using the HTML canvas element. The snake moves with arrow keys, and the game ends if it hits the wall or collides with itself. The food appears randomly on the grid, and the snake grows when it eats the food.

You can further enhance the game by adding features like scoring, game over screen, difficulty levels, and more sophisticated graphics and animations. But this should serve as a solid foundation to get you started.
